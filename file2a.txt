Abduction is defined as "inference to the best explanation," 
a task of generating an explanation to account for the 
appearance of a given set of findings or data [8].  Within 
the context of handwritten character recognition, the task 
is one of hypothesizing the characters (or symbols/words) 
responsible for the features found in scanned bitmaps; 
the task attempts to find the best collection of characters to 
explain these features.  Abduction has previously been 
applied to a wide range of interpretation problems including 
speech recognition [9], diagnosis [10, 11, 12], medical test 
interpretation [13], story understanding [14], natural 
language understanding [9, 15], theory formation and legal 
reasoning [16].
